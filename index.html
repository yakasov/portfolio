        <h3 class="title">About</h3>
        Hi - my name is James McDougall, and I'm a software developer from the
        UK. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science,
        achieving a first. This is my portfolio.
        <br /><br />
        I know it doesn't look like much, and I know it doesn't demonstrate many
        skills, especially relating to CSS or JavaScript. But this website
        intends to follow the ethos above, of keeping a website simple by making
        sure the design is simple and the load time is minimal.
        <br /><br />
        I have several other projects that better show off what I can do. You
        can find my GitHub page
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/yakasov/">here</a>.

        <br /><br /><br />
        <h3 class="title">Experience</h3>
        <b>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</b> <br />
        <i>University of Portsmouth</i> <br />
        <i>Sep 2020 - Jul 2024</i> <br />
        <br />
        I studied Computer Science with a year in industry and achieved a First
        with Honours.

        <br /><br />
        <br />
        <b>Assistant Developer</b> <br />
        <i>ProspectSoft (The Access Group)</i> <br />
        <i> Aug 2022 - Aug 2023</i> <br />
        <br />
        I worked alongside permanent developers at ProspectSoft and took on many
        programming tasks of my own. During this time, I used TypeScript, SQL,
        C# and other tools to create a fantastic product for consumers.
        <br /><br />Additionally, I oversaw recruitment for future developer
        placements, which involved vetting applicants, sending technical tests
        and conducting phone interviews.

        In my free-time, I work on and maintain several of the projects found to

        Deathcore, Screamo and similar. Some of my favourite bands include

        Mice & Men and SeeYouSpaceCowboy, to name just a few.

        am very lucky to own
        <ul>
          <li>
            an <b>Epiphone Les Paul Special II</b>, which I keep mostly in
            Standard tuning
          </li>

            an <b>Ibanez SEW761FM-NTF S Series</b>, which is usually for Drop C
            down to Drop A
          </li>
          <li>
            a <b>Schecter Omen Elite-7</b>, built for lower tunings such as Drop
            F#
          </li>

        BioShock, System Shock, and Overwatch. I have previously played D&D 5e
        and now more regularly play Pathfinder 2e (and yes, I have played
        Baldur's Gate 3, which was brilliant!)
